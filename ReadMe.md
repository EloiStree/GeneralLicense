The license in short:

> All my codes/tools/games are free & open source based on a monthly coffee donation license.    
> I trust my users to support me when they can with the amount equivalent of a coffee.  
> If your are an individual or company and you use my tools for commercial reason, you must buy a life time license of use [here](https://ko-fi.com/eloistree).
> 
> It authorizes the given named individual or company of using all my codes and tools for commercial reason in one license.
> No bug support, not tech support, not help is in this package. It is just a license of use. 
> 
> For none commercial use, the license is the following:  
> https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/  
> 
> 
> If you wonder how do I control this license:
> - My codes and tools are clean of backdoor (as they are open source)
> - I have a none intrusive toolbox and some bot(s) to check if a Unity application on the store has one of my tool in it. 
>   - No hacking, just public files reading.
> - I check my database of licenses to check if the company/individual has the authorization.
> - If I detect a commercial use without license, a mail will be send to the owner of the application. 
>   - Followed by a report to the store owner
>   - Followed by a lawyer some weeks later if not answer/action.
